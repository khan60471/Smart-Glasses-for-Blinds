# Smart Glasses for Blinds

This Final Year Project (FYP) aims to develop a pair of smart glasses designed to assist visually impaired individuals. The smart glasses are equipped with advanced features such as Object Detection, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Pose Estimation to provide real-time assistance and navigation support.

## Introduction

The Smart Glasses for Blinds project integrates computer vision and machine learning technologies to enhance the independence and mobility of visually impaired individuals. The glasses can detect objects, recognize text, and estimate poses, providing audio feedback to the user for real-time navigation and information.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Identifies and classifies objects in the user's surroundings, helping them navigate safely and efficiently.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Recognizes and reads out text from various sources such as signs, documents, and labels.
- **Pose Estimation**: Estimates the position and orientation of the user, assisting with spatial awareness and movement.
